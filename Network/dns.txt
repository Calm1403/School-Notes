DNS stands for domain name system; servers that are part of the domain name system
are tasked with the resolution of domains to addresses.

A local resolver will communicate with the root domain name server to get the servers
associated to a particular top level domain and thus thw IP of the server of the
service under that domain; a DNS zone represents a portion of the
DNS namespace that an organisation manages, which allows managers
to have a more granular control over the DNS components, such as an authoritative nameserver.

A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace managed by specific administrator.

A DNS zone could be througt of as a collection of domain name spaces, where a domain name
space is a collection of domain names. 

A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a DNS server; a text file that
starts with the special DNS record SOA, meaning start of authority and contains
all records for the resources described within the zone.

A DNS record is an instruction that lives within an authoritative DNS server, providing information
about a domain and what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for it.

Tells the internet where to find a domain's address.

These records have a time to live, which implies the number of time taken before a server
refreshes.

Records:
A               - Holds the adress of a domain (IPv4).
AAAA 		- The record containing the IPv6 address for a domain.
CNAME record    - Forwards a domain or subdomain to another domain; doesn't provide an IP address.
MX record       - Directs mail to an email server.
TXT record      - Lets an admin s tore text notes in the record; email security.
NS record  	- Stores the name server for a DNS entry. 

Under the root zone, the domain namespace is organised in a layout of subdomains below
the root domain '.'. The period is typically implicit with most URIs.

The domain name system is segregated into this way so subdomains of a domain can be
managed individually, and independently.

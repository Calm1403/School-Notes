DNS:

  DNS stands for domain name system; servers that are part of the domain name system
  are tasked with the resolution of domains to addresses.

  They take a URI, and return the address of the service server associated to that URI.

  A local resolver will communicate with the root domain name server to get the servers
  associated to a particular top level domain and thus the IP of the server of the
  service under that domain.

DNS Stages:

  DNS recursor/resolver:

    This is a server designed to receive queries from client machines
    through applications, such as a web browser; its typically
    responsible for making additional requests in order to satisfy
    the DNS query.

    The resolver may be on the client computer itself; a service
    called systemd-resolved is available on Linux for this
    exact purpose.

    It'll typically make a query to a root DNS server.

  Root name server:

    The root name server is the second step taken to translating
    domains into IP addresses; it's a collection of server addresses
    for top level domain name servers.

  TLD name server:

    This holds the servers associated to the last portion of a domain
    name; '.com' is a valid example of TLD.

    This is a collection of server addresses, under
    the particular TLD header, for authoritative name
    servers for services hosted under that TLD.

  Authoritative name server:

    This is the last stop in the query; if the name server
    has access to the requested record, it'll return the
    address for the requested domain name back to the DNS resolver.

DNS Zones:

  A DNS zone represents a portion of the
  DNS namespace that an organisation manages, which allows managers
  to have a more granular control over the DNS components, such
  as an authoritative name server.

  A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a DNS
  server; a text file that starts with the special DNS record SOA,
  meaning start of authority and contains all records for the
  resources described within the zone.

DNS Records:

  A DNS record is an instruction that lives within an authoritative 
  DNS server, providing information about a domain and what IP 
  address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests 
  for it.

  These records have a time to live, which implies the number of time 
  taken before a server refreshes this information.

  Record types:

    A - Holds the adress of a domain (IPv4).
    AAAA - Holds IPv6 address for a domain.
    CNAME record - Forwards a domain or subdomain to another domain.
    MX record - Directs mail to an email server.
    TXT record - Lets an admin store text notes in the record.
    NS record - Stores the name server for a DNS entry.

  Under the root zone, the domain namespace is organised in a layout
  of subdomains below the root domain '.'. The period is typically
  implicit with most URIs.

  The domain name system is segregated into this way so subdomains of 
  a domain can be managed individually, and independently.

App images:

	App images are a means for upstream devs to provide binaries for Linux users
	the same way they could do for other operating systems.

	It permits the packaging of applications for any linux based operating system.

	App images come with all the dependencies that cannot be assumed to be
	part of each target system; will run on most linux ditributions without
	much modification.

	When an AppImage is run, the executable header of the AppImage, called
	the runtime, is executed; this mounts the embedded read only file system image
	in a temporary location and launches the payload application.

	An AppImage is essentially an encapsulation of executable code and a
	read only file system. 

Running an app image:

	1. Make the app image executable via chmod +x <appimage>.AppImage
	2. Run the executable via ./<appimage>.AppImage

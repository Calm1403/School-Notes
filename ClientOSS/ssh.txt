SSH:

  SSH is a remote shell program; it allows you to run a computer's shell session remotely.

  Note that it may also be able to remotely execute X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports
  and Unix-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

PORTS:

  Securely, ssh will use port 22; it'll use port 23 typically in the case of an insecure
  telnet-like connection.

  Telnet was written as a remote shell program during the first stages of ARPANET; it was written
  in 1969, later being replaced by open ssh in the year 2000, 31 years later.

USAGE:

  To use ssh, type the following in a shell environment on a computer with an ssh implmentation
  like openSSH installed.

    ~$ ssh <host>@<address>[:<port>]

  The box brackets just indicate that the port is option, and doesn't need to be specified making
  ssh assume the port being used is the typical one.

  You'll be prompted with a password requirement.

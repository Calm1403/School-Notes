SSH:

  SSH is a remote shell program; it allows you to run a computer's shell session remotely.

  Note that it may also be able to remotely execute X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports
  and Unix-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

PORTS:

  Securely, ssh will use port 22; it'll use port 23 typically in the case of an insecure
  telnet-like connection.

  Telnet was written as a remote shell program during the first stages of ARPANET; it was written
  in 1969, later being replaced by open ssh in the year 2000, 31 years later.

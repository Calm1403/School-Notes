WSL:

  The windows subsystem for linux is
  a virtual machine running in the
  windows hypervisor.

  It's very similar to docker, using
  resources on the fly as opposed to
  preallocation.

In a windows shell:

  ~$ wsl --install

  This will install the subsystem.

  You'll then be asked to set a new
  password:

  ~$ New password:

Overview:

  This is really good for linux programming; you're
  also able to do loads of other things like running
  a desktop environment, docker integration,
  gpu acceleration, it's all supported.

Docker images:
  A docker container is an executing image; a docker image is a standardised package containing
  everything needed to run an application; they can be distributed and shared with others.

The docker hub:
  This is where you share images.

  Docker hub is the default and go to registry for images.

Pulling containers:
  Usage: docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]

  Example: docker pull docker/welcome-to-docker

  A line in this output represents a downloaded layer of the image;
  each layer represents a set of file system changes where data is
  modified.

  Images are immutable; an image created can't be modified, but it
  can be added to or replaced with a new image.

Docker image info:
  You can find the docker image history by using the history verb.

  You can also find the docker image info using the ls verb.

  Example: docker image (history|ls)

Repositories and registries:
  A repository is not a registry; a repository is a collection of related images in a registry, where a registry is
  a pool of images.

Running containers:
  You can run containers using the run verb.

  Example: docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker

Building images:
  You can build images by git pulling projects with docker build for projects with docker integration.

  This is done by including a Dockerfile, a text based script instruction set for building the image.

  Example:

    1. git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app
    2. cd getting-started-todo-app
    3. docker build -t <DOCKER_USERNAME>/getting-started-todo-app.
    4. docker image ls

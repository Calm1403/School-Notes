PPA:

  A ppa is a software repository containing source packages
  that are built and published by anyone interested in
  a facilitated means of distributing their software.

  They're used as an APT repository entry by canonical's launchpad service.

  Anyone could make a PPA which means they're not very secure; they could
  be easily used to ditribute melicious code.

  You can add a PPA through the following commands.

    1. sudo apt-get-repository ppa:<repository>
    2. sudo apt-get update
    3. sudo apt-get install <name of application from repository>

  There's four kinds of repository:
  
    1. Main - Canonical Supported FOSS repositories.
    2. Universe - Community maintained FOSS repositories.
    3. Restricted - Proprietary drivers.
    4. Multiverse - software restricted by copyright issues.

  You can see these sources in /etc/apt/ in the source.d file or the source.d
  directory therein.

  I don't personally like using these because it's a canonical product; as it is
  with snap packages. 

  I'd prefer flat packages, the arch user repository, or app images which is
  arguably worse but hey, viva' la open source; I'd take docker too, that's
  pretty damn good.

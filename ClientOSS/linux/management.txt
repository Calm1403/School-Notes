User Management:

  These are a set of useful commands for user management.

    1.  Useradd - creates a new user account.

        User add creates a new user account; the D flag will
        determine whether or not the command reads values
        specified from the command line along with
        default values from the system, it does so
        if the D flag is omitted during invocation.

        Useful flags:

          Skeleton Directory ( (-k | --skel) SKEL_DIR ):

            The skeleton director contains files and directories to be
            copied to the user's home directory; used when the home directory is
            created by useradd, with the (-m | --create-home) flag is specified.

            If this flag isn't set, the skeleton directory will be defaulted
            to the skeleton directory specified /etc/skel or /etc/default/useradd.

          Home ( (-m | --create-home) ):

            This creates a user's home directory if it does not already exist; files and
            directories contained within the skeleton directory will be coppied to the
            home directory of the new user.

            By default, if this option is not specified and CREATE_HOME isn't enabled, no home
            directory is created; the user is just added.

          Groups ( (-G | --groups) GROUP1[,GROUP2,...] ):

            This is the list groups that the user is to be a member of; multiple groups
            may be specified, delimited by commas.

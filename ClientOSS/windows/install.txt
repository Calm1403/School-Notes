Installing windows:

  The windows installation is pretty straightforward; just follow
  the GUI, basically.

  During the install, during the setup stage, you can create a terminal
  session through the key sequence shift+F10 to
  open an administrative command prompt (there's
  no account currently at this point).

  Skip internet connection:

    ~$ oobe/bypassnro

    This tells the windows setup to use offline mode, bypassing
    the need to establish an internet connection. It stands for "out
    of box experience."

    ~$ start ms-cxh:localonly

    This instantiates the create account GUI; here you can create
    a local account in the setup phase, reboot, and login to that
    account created; simple no fuss.

  Debloating:

    I personally quite like using Win11Debloat.

    Once windows is installed, open powershell and write the following.

    ~$ & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://debloat.raphi.re")))

    This will install the script and run it via powershell; follow
    the prompt carefully and select what you want to be included
    during the debloat.

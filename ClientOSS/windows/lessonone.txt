Practical assessment:

  In the practical, make sure to take screenshots loads
  of screenshots; everything must be documented.

  Ensure that both EFI and secure boot are enabled.

OEM:

  Original Equipment Manager; these people often install
  an operating on computers on their products, people like
  dell, intel or apple for e.g. These lot typically
  prevent people from being required to install an
  operating system through a boot drive.

TPM:

  The trusted platform module is a cryptographic chip
  designed to verify the boot process through cryptographic
  keys; typical uses involve a verification of the sequence of
  hardware and software that boots the operating system, the
  generation of cryptographic keys, random number generation
  and so on.

  Windows required version 2.0 of this standard to be implemented in order
  to run.

Installing windows:

  During the install, during the setup stage, you can create a terminal
  session through the key sequence shift+F10 to
  open an administrative command prompt (there's
  no account currently at this point).

  Skip internet connection:

    ~$ oobe/bypassnro

    This tells the windows setup to use offline mode, bypassing
    the need to establish an internet connection. It stands for "out
    of box experience."

  Skip using an email:

    ~$ start ms-cxh:localonly

    This instantiates the create account GUI; here you can create
    a local account in the setup phase, reboot, and login to that
    account created; simple no fuss.

  Debloating:

    I personally quite like using Win11Debloat.

    Once windows is installed, open powershell and write the following.

    ~$ & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://debloat.raphi.re")))

    This will install the script and run it via powershell; follow
    the prompt carefully and select what you want to debloat.

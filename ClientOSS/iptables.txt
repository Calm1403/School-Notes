What is it? :

IP tables are used to setup, maintain, and inspect packet filter rules
in the Linux kernel through the manipulation of 'Tables.'

A table contains a number of builtin or user-defined 'chains.'

A chain is a list of rules that can match a set of network packets.

A packet that matches according the defined rules of a chain is called
a 'target.'

A firewall rule specifies the criteria for a packet and a target. If a packet does
not match, it's naturally not a target for that rule; the next rule in the chain 
is then examined.

You can think of a table as a list of chains, lists of rules; a table
is a list of lists of rules.

Table:
  Chain 1:
    Rule 1.
    Rule 2.
    ...
    Rule N.
  Chain 2:
    Rule 1.
    Rule 2.
    ...
    Rule N.
  ...
  Chain N:
    Rule 1.
    Rule 2.
    ...
    Rule N.

Commmand Example. :

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j \
  REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>

The NAT table, as specified by '-t nat' is used to refer to packets that create
new connections. 

The pre-routing chain specifies that we're altering the packets as soon as they're received;
the '-A' flag is a means of specifying that we want to (A)PPEND this chain to the 
table specified.

The '-p' specifies the protocol used for transferring information, in this case we're looking at the Tele-communications Protocol; destination-port corresponds with the port we're watching 
to receive these packets, in this case port 80 which corresponds to HTTP; we're watching for
HTTP connections that use TCP.

The '-j' flag specifies what to do when we receive these packets; we (J)UMP to this instruction
and carry it out, which in this case is the act of redirecting to a given port as specified
by the REDIRECT builtin.

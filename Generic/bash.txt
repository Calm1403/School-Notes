Symbols:

  The dash:
    The dash symbol allows you to specify the standard I/o streams, as apposed to a file;
    for example:

      ~$ mkisofs -V Photos -r /home/user/photos | cdrecord -v dev=/dev/dvdrw -

    Cdrecord will take the standard output from mkisofs as standard input; places
    this input at the front of the command.

    Note that the meaning of this symbol is ambiguous; commands will interpret it differently.

    For example, using the dash with the change directory command:

      ~$ cd -

    will return the user to the directory visited prior.

Preface:
	Symbols surrounded by box brackets are optional.

Interactivity:

	A bash shell can be invoked either interactively, or non interactively; this means that
  the shell is either receiving input from the keyboard, or a file respectively.

Compound commands:

	A compound command is a collection of simple commands; either a list, a pipe, or a loop.

Pipes:

	A pipe is of the following syntax: command1 [| command2]

	The output of each command is the input of the next; each command read's the previous one's output. Each command of a pipline is executed in
        its own subshell; the execution environment. The return value of a pipeline is the return value of the
        last command to be executed in the pipeline.

Lists:

	A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines seperated by one of the operators ';', '&', '&&', or '||', and optionally
	terminated by one of ';', '&', or a newline.

	If a command is terminated by the control operator '&', the shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell; this
        executes the command in the background. The shell does not wait for the command to finish execution.

Wild Card:

	Astrix '*' is a wild card and will search for anything given a pattern; specifyi
	ng no pattern implies all. You can also use {} to create multiple files; it's an expression for a range or list. 

	It's in a {n..m} format if a range, where n and m are arbitrary integers. For a
	list, you can specify a list; {n1, n2, ..., nm}.

	Anystring of text before or after the astrix will server as a pattern to be
	matched against; it may be used as argument.

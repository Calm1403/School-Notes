You can use netplan to configure the networking for an interface.

You can select whether or not it's configured either through a static IP or DHCP.

It can be used to generate configurations for the underlying network manager 
using netplan generate; translates YAML configs into the underlying format and
places these in the configuration directories for the network daemon.

Netplan apply:

  ~$ netplan apply

  Applies the current Netplan configuration to a running system.

Netplan try:

  ~$ netplan try

  Will automatically reset the configuration if the user doesn't confirm the change.

Netplan get:
  
  ~$ netplan get

  Returns the configurations under /{etc,lib,run}/netplan/*.yml. It kinda collages them
  together.

Netplan set:

  ~$ netplan set

  This will write a given key value pair to /etc/netplan and
  validate the format.

Netplan set:

  ~$ netplan status

  Displays the current network status.

To use netplan to enable a network interface you can use the command:

  ~$ netplan set --origin-hint second-interface ethernets.enp6s0.dhcp4=true

  The --origin-hint second-interface portion specifies the name of the file
  where the configuration for this file will be stored.

  The second portion specifies the interface; in this case that it's an
  ethernet interface called enp6s0 that makes use of dynamic host configuration
  to allocate an ipv4 address.

  You'll want to ensure that the interface actually exists too.

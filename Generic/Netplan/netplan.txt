You can use netplan to configure the networking for an interface.

You can select whether or not it's configured either through a static IP or DHCP
.

It can be used to generate configurations for the underlying network manager 
using netplan generate; translates YAML configs into the underlying format and
places these in the configuration directories for the network daemon.

netplan apply; applies the current Netplan configuration to a running system.

netplan try; will automatically reset the configuration if the user
doesn't confirm the change.

netplan get; returns the configurations under /{etc,lib,run}/netplan/*.yml.

It kinda collages them together.

netplan set; this will write a given key value pair to /etc/netplan and
validate the format.

netplan status; displays the current network status.

To use netplan to enable a network interface you can use the command:

netplan set --origin-hint second-interface ethernets.enp6s0.dhcp4=true

The --origin-hint second-iinterface portion specifies the name of the file
where the configuration for this file will be stored.

The second portion specifies the interface; in this case that it's an
ethernet interface called enp6s0 that makes use of dynamic host configuration
to allocate an ipv4 address.

You'll want to ensure that the interface actually exists too.

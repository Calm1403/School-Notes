Installing repositories in apt:

  Apt repositories would be contained within
  a single file including third parties.

  They would be typically contained within
  the /etc/apt/source.list file.

  Now they're typically contained within
  their own repositories to
  segregate them for easy management in the 
  /etc/apt/source.list.d directory.

  PPAs (Personal Package Archives) are a means
  for developers to distribute their software
  on ubuntu based distributions; you can
  add PPAs to the sources.

  They can be thought of as third party
  repositories.

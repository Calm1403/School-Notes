Core Dumped:

  Core dumped refers to the displacement of an active process' execution context
  (it's memory usage, program counter, stack pointer and so on) to a file
  on abnormal termination.

Fetch Execute Cycle:

  Units and Registers:
    MAR (Memory Address Register):
    
      The memory address register holds the address of the next value to be
      read from main memory.

    MDR (Memory Data Register):

      This is a two way register; it data is both read and written to this
      register.

      On read, the data addressed by the location in the MAR is used to
      populate the MDR.

      On write, data in the MDR is written to the location in the MAR corresponding
      to some point in the main memory.

    CC (Control Unit):

      The CC manages the coordination of the CPU; coordinates communications
      between I/o devices and other units, including their timing and the
      signals sent to them.

    PC (Program Counter):

      The program counter contains the address of the next instruction to be
      executed by the control unit.

    IR (Instruction Register):

      The instruction register holds the data representing the CPU instruction.

      The instruction register is typically split into two parts; we call them
      IR(OP) and IR(ADDR)

  Operations of the fetch execute cycle.

    The PC is set to contain the address of the next instruction; this is then copied
    into the MAR.

    The CPU does this by sending a read request, through the control
    bus, to the RAM, to tell the RAM to return the address
    currently being pointed to by the PC, passing the relevant address through
    the address register.

    The data within RAM referred to by the MAR is then placed
    within the MDR, being passed through to it on the data bus, then
    to the IR through the same means if the data is an opcode; it's not immediately 
    copied to the instruction register because it may be another kind of data.

    It should be noted that the value within the instruction register is segmented
    being composed of one IR(OP) opcode segment, and at most two IR(ADDR)
    segments, and that the data bus is bidirectional for both reading and writing.
    The most significant bits tend to compose the opcode.

    Then, the IR(OP) segment of the instruction is then decoded by the CC.

    The PC is then incremented by one.

    Overview:

      1. MAR <- PC
      2. MDR <- <MAR>
      3.  IR <- MDR
      4.  PC <- PC + 1

    Suppose that the opcode represented by IR(OP) was LOAD <A>, B; this corresponds
    with loading the accumulator with the value B at the address <A>.
    
    The IR(ADDR) portion(s) of the value within the instruction register corresponds to
    an operand, which is a value used in an operation.

    With the LOAD example, LOAD <A>, B has the following register usage:

      1. MAR <- IR(ADDR)
      2. MDR <- <MAR>
      3.  AC <- MDR # Now we know its data.

Ticket:

  The ticket aims to serve as a
  quick summary of what you did
  to resolve a problem.

Report:

  The report should aim to be
  a holistic overview of
  the steps taken to resolve the
  problem; what you did, how
  it was done, what you
  used to do what you did
  to do what was done; it
  should be structured orderly
  including the six stages
  of trouble shooting and
  the OSI model if a network
  problem.

What to do:

  When tasked to trouble shoot
  you should include the report
  and the ticket.

  You should also create a
  spread sheet or a
  word document of what
  you did; order each
  step by a number
  along with relevant
  information like the
  expected result, the
  actual result, a comment
  on the outcome, the
  step name, so on.

  You can export the
  ticket into a PDF
  document; this should
  also be included.

  There should be a cover
  sheet included; it isn't
  strictly required at
  the HNC level.

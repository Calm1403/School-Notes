Ticket:

  The ticket aims to serve as a
  quick summary of what you did
  to resolve a problem.

Report:

  The report should aim to be
  a holistic overview of
  the steps taken to resolve the
  problem; what you did, how
  it was done, what you
  used to do what you did
  to do what was done; it
  should be structured orderly
  including the six stages
  of trouble shooting and
  the OSI model if a network
  problem.

What to do:

  You should also create a
  spread sheet or a
  word document of what
  you did; order each
  step by a number
  along with relevant
  information like the
  expected result, the
  actual result, a comment
  on the outcome, the
  step name, so on.

  You can export the
  ticket into a PDF
  document; this should
  also be included.

  There should be a cover
  sheet included; it isn't
  strictly required at
  the HNC level.

  The ticket section should
  include the entire ticket;
  the conversation between the
  client and the troubleshooter.

  In the report, you should
  always give reasoning as to
  what you're doing.

  The trouble shooting methodology,
  the questions, all doing should be
  backed by reasoning; references
  should be made the both the report
  and the ticket.

  The referencing in the ticket doesn't
  need to be citations; URLs are fine.

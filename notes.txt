NOTE:

You should use zenmap for the test because it's easier to read.

-F: Fast mode - Scan fewer ports than the default scan.

<user>/desktop/workspace contains the results of:

sudo nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA active_ports 192.168.100.0/24 --verbose

-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
-sC: equivalent to --script=default

-oA active_ports generates output files.

We remove the -oA flag in zenmap to not output files.

SMB is a server message block protocol; client-server communication
protocol that is used for sharing access to files, devices and serial
ports.

The network basic input output system is an implementation of session layer
of the OSI model, allowing applications on separate computers to communicate
over a local area network.

This allows us to potentially get information about the operating systems of hosts
running on a network.

Do all the scanning at the start, then again at the end to ensure that
the problems were resolved.

You can save scans from zenmap to review previous results; I've saved them to
desktop/workspace.

NetBIOS isn't a protocol, it's an implementation.

Active:

  – Interaction with the target
  – Could be a company or a person, e.g.
    • Contacting on social media
    • Making a phone call to the target
    • Doing a port scan

Passive:

  – Gain information on a company or person, e.g.
    • ‘Google’ search on Microsoft
    • Looking at social media information such as Facebook posts, e.g.
  – Products they are launching
  – Employees and their titles

Finger printing allows you to get various extents of information on
security postures; what OS is being used, what services are they running,
are they using cloud? It also helps identify vulnerabilities. All
for a particular or range of targets.

Tools:

  - Nikto.          - Gathers website information; looks for vulnerabilities.
  - theHarvester.   - Gathers domain information.
  - Maltego.        - Intelligence platform; searches for DNS records and osint info about people.
  - Recon-ng.       - General recon framework.
  - OSRFramework.   - Open source recon framework.
  - Shodan.         - Hacker website for finding network information about servers.
  - Google hacking. - Google dorks; a hacker database.
  - whois           - Whois lookup tool for domains.

OSINT:

  Open source intelligence is the collection of data gathered
  from open sources, those overt services publicly available, to
  be analysed and used to produce actionable intelligence.

  This means access to this information through OSINT programs
  is completely legal.

Whois:

  Whois is a query and response protocol for querying databases; stores
  internet resources, registered users or assignees.

  The resources include domain names, IP address blocks and autonomous
  systems, but this may be extended.

Shodan:

  This allows vulnerabilities to be found on the internet; it's
  a hacker's search engine.

The harvester:

  This is a tools for gathering subdomain names, email addresses
  virutal hosts, open ports, banners and employee names from
  public sources like search engines and gpg key servers.

  Aside (banner):

    A banner is textual information conveying the detail
    relevant to the type and version of software running
    on a network host.

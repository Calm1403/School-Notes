  ~$ sudo apt install metasploit-framework

Running:

  ~$ msrfdb

Meterpreter:

  This is an abbreviation for metasploit interpreter.

  The meterpreter shell appears in the terminal of your attacking
  machine; it gives you access to a shell session of the target.

  An executable file should be created by msfvenom to be downloaded
  to the target's machine.

  Lists the options relevant to the module.

Eternal blue remote code execution:

  In the module windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue:

  LHOST should be set to the attacking host, the local host; RHOSTS are the targets.

  msf > set RHOSTS 192.168.100.2

  LPORT represents the port to be exploited, RHOSTS represents the port to go through on local host.

  windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp is a payload.


Payloads, a clarification:

  The payload is a program set over the network, there's many designed for
  all kinds of scenarios.

  There are two types of payload: staged and single.
 
  A staged payload consists of two main components, a stub loader and a final stage payload.

  When you deliver windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp for instance, you actually
  send the loader first; when the loader is executed, it will ask the handler
  on the attacker's side to send over the final stage.

  You can think of it as part one and two epoxy resin; both are useless on their
  own, but they work together for an overall result.

  A single stage payload is payload designed to be sent off in one; can be used
  when the target has no network access.

  We create a reverse bind connection that's running on the port of the Kali.

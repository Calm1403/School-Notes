Protocol - Definition:

  According to geeks for geeks, a networking protocol can be thought
  of as a set of rules that collectively govern the means of communication
  between different hosts on the network.

  For example, the telecommunications protocol (TCP) is a reliable transport
  layer protocol that, in practice, ensures data is always received in the
  converse between two hosts, using a 'three way handshake,' a three step
  process, to ensure a stable connection.

  Protocols may run at any layer that their purposed for, they're more
  like implementation guidance for open system processes, take a secure
  shell session implementation like openSSH for example, which runs at
  the session layer of the OSI model.

  RIP:

    The routing information protocol (RIP) prevents a routing loop, which
    is a common problem within networking; they're formed when
    an error occurs with the routing algorithm, where in a group of
    nodes, resultantly the formation of a loop occurs.

    [A]-->[B]
     |     |
     |     X  <-- Disconnection; broken network.
     |     v
     +--->[C]

    A node A thinks that the path to a destination C is through
    another node B; B thinks that the path to C starts through A.

    A and B are then in a two node loop; so they constantly go through
    each other in attempt to get to the inaccessible C node.

    RIP attempts to prevent this situation from occurring by
    implementing a limit on the number of on the number of
    hops, an instance of an address being routed.

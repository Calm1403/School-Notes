Ports:

  A port is a point where network connection start and end.

Justification:

  They're software based and managed by the computer's OS.

  Ports allow for an easy means of identifying particular
  services, with each service being associated to a respective
  port.

  These ports help the computer understand what to do with
  the data that they receive; they're standardised across
  all the network connected devices.

  For example, port 21 specifies ssh; 80 specifies HTTPS.

Distinction to IP addresses:

  IP addresses enable messages to get
  to and from specific network devices, where
  port numbers allow the targeting
  of particular services within those
  devices; a socket is a combination
  of these two ideas.

OSI Layer:

  Ports are part of the TCP/UDP transport layer, or the TCP/IP stack.

  Both networking protocols specify what ports
  that packets will go through.

Ports and distinctions amongst them:
  
  Ports for services are made distinct through numbers;
  for example, port 22 typically refers to a secure remote
  shell session through the SSH protocol and port 23 refers
  to an older ARPANET sell session through the Telnet protocol.

The gvm is greenbone's community addition vulnerability assessment scanner manager.

  /usr/lib/systemd/system/gsad.service is the configuration file.

  You'll want to edit the --listen flag at the ExecStart entry.

Install greenbone vulnerability assessment scanner on kali:

  sudo apt-get install gmv -y

Setup installation, download dependencies:

  gvm-setup

Check setup:

  gvm-check-setup -h

Start:

  gvm-start -h

Stop:

  gvm-stop -h

To perform vulnerability assessment scanning, information like CVEs, port lists and scan configs are
required; these are known as feeds.

Data included can be:

  1. VT (Vulnerability testing) data; contains .nasl and .notus files for creating results.
  2. SCAP (security content automation protocol) data; used in providing information of vulnerabilities.
  3. CERT data; structured data for known vulnerabilities.
  4. GVMD (greenbone vulnerability management data), used by the gvmd: port lists, scanner configs.

  These contain both CPE and CVE data; common platform enumeration and common vulnerability and exposures.

  Updating the feeds is crucial when mitigating with vulnerabilities.

You can update the feeds by the following command.

  ~$ greenbone-feed-sync

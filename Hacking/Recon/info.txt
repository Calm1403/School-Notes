When performing recon, make note of the services running on the machine.

They can determine whether or not an operating system is a long term
support distribution; when it comes to assessments, take
screen shots of potential vulnerabilities. Distributions
that aren't LTS in ubuntu's sake typically have nine
months of support; they don't get security updates after
that.

During the report writing, you can and should do
a before and after scan to demonstrate the correction.

Setting up tor:

Installing:
  sudo apt-get install tor -y

Info:
  The tor daemon allows us to route traffic through the tor net; this is our proxy.

  To start the tor daemon:

  ~$ sudo systemctl start tor.service

Setting up proxy chains:
  sudo apt-get install proxychains4 -y

Info:
  We use proxychains4 to enable the usage of proxies for networked applications.

  To do this we write:

  ~$ proxychains4 <command>

  The proxychains4 command is configured in /etc/proxychains4.conf.

  The tor daemon uses port 9050 on localhost to connect to the tornet.

  To ensure in /etc/proxychains4.conf;

    1. socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 is set under [ProxyList].
    
       Tor uses port 9050 on the local machine to connect to the tor net. 
       Socks5 enable proxies to use UDP and TCP.

    2. dynamic-chain is enabled.

       This ensures that dead proxies are skipped over; there may be dead ones in
       the tor net.

    3. proxy_dns is enabled.

       This ensures that DNS requests are proxied too; chance of dns leaks reduces.

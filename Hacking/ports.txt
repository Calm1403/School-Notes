Ports:

  A port is a point where network connection start and end.

Justification:

  They're software based and managed by the computer's OS.

  Ports allow for an easy means of identifying particular
  services, with each service being associated to a respective
  port.

  These ports help the computer understand what to do with
  the data that they receive; they're standardised across
  all the network connected devices.

  For example, port 21 specifies ssh; 80 specifies HTTPS.

Distinction to IP addresses:

  IP address enable messages to got
  to and from specific devices, where
  port numbers allow the targeting
  of particular services within those
  devices; a socket is a combination
  of these two ideas.

OSI Layer:

  Ports are part of the TCP/UDP transport layer.

  Both networking protocols specify what ports
  that packets will go through.

Common Ports:

  22 - SSH
  23 - Telnet
  443 - TCP / HTTPS
  8443 - Also HTTPS
  3389 - Remote desktop protocol
  80 - HTTP
  67 - DHCP server
  53 - Local Resolver (DNS)
  631 - Cups printer interface.

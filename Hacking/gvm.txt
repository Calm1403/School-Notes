sudo apt-get install gmv -y

To perform vulnerability assessment scanning, information like CVEs, port lists and scan configs are
required; these are known as feeds.

Data included can be:

VT (Vulnerability testing) data; contains .nasl and .notus files for creating results. 
SCAP (security content automation protocol) data; used in providing information of vulnerabilities.

This contains both CPE and CVE data; common platform enumeration and common vulnerability and exposures.

CERT data; structured data for known vulnerabilities.
GVMD (greenbone vulnerability management daemon) data used by the gvmd: port lists, scanner configs.

Updating the feeds is crucial when mitigating with vulnerabilities.

You can update the feeds by writing:

greenbone-feed-sync

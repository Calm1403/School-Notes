These are a list of common methods for performing a successful cyber attack:

Dictionary Attack:

  A dictionary attack entails the attacker using words from a list
  of words, a dictionary, in hope one words of the dictionary
  is the correct password unlocking the target machine.

  Typically these are passwords easily guessable.

Brute Force:

  Trial and error; performed by an application to decode encrypted
  information, like passwords or Data Encryption Standards (DES).

  This is an example of a brute force attack.

Rule Based:

  This is used when segments of a password are known; a set of rules
  and a word list is required, where these rules define
  a pre-process that each word in the word will under go
  before being put though a hashing algorithm.
  
  By compiling lists of rules that emulate user behaviour, a simple
  word list can become a highly efficient means of cracking passwords
  by generating other likely passwords.

Rainbow tables:

  A rainbow table allows passwords to be cracked in a very
  short amount of time.

  They're essential huge sets of precomputed tables filled
  with hash values that are pre matched.

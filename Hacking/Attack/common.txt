These are a list of common methods for performing a successful cyber attack:

Dictionary Attack:

  A dictionary attack entails the attacker using words from a list
  of words, a dictionary, in hope one words of the dictionary
  is the correct password unlocking the target machine.

  Typically these are passwords easily guessable.

Brute Force:

  Trial and error; performed by an application to decode encrypted
  information, like passwords or Data Encryption Standards (DES).

  This is an example of a brute force attack.

Rule Based:

  This is used when segments of a password are known; a set of rules
  and a word list is required, where these rules define
  a pre-process that each word in the word will under go
  before being put though a hashing algorithm.
  
  By compiling lists of rules that emulate user behaviour, a simple
  word list can become a highly efficient means of cracking passwords
  by generating other likely passwords.

Rainbow tables:

  A rainbow table allows passwords to be cracked in a very
  short amount of time.

  They're essential huge sets of precomputed tables filled
  with hash values that are pre matched.

  Protecting Passwords:

    If you want to protect passwords, a common method is
    through salting; additional textual information is
    added to the password to alter the unique hash associated
    to it.

    [Test] -> [Test('ac;cm)] -> Hash Box -> f52b32934jd9234nsl239dsd93halikh34sdf9

    The salt along with the resultant hash is added to the password
    store.

Password Hacking:

  This is fun and there's many ways to go about it.

  Air Crack:

    Aircrack-ng is a wireless password cracker.

    Note that even on kali linux it's difficult to use this program
    due to the fact that to use it effectively, you need to
    patch the wireless interface's drivers manually to be able to
    use the monitory and injection modes; it's better to use this
    on an actual operating system.

    It's good if you're bloody desperate to scan a coffee shop
    network or your own; it's highly sophisticated.

  John the ripper:

    John the ripper is a 'password recovery tool,' it can be used as
    such but we're going to use it to hack passwords.

    It detects week unix passwords.

    Usage:

        ~$ john <password file>

      This will use the default order of modes.

      If we want to specify various kinds of modes.

        ~$ john --wordlist=<password list>.lst --rules <password rules>

        This restricts it to one word list using the word list mode
        and particular word mangling rules with the rules mode.

        Cracked passwords will be printed to the terminal and saved in the
        $JOHN/john.pot file.

        You can display cracked passwords with the following.

          ~$ john --show passwd

      Modes:

        Wordlist mode is the simple cracking mode; you specify a wordlist and some password files.

        Shadow Passwords:
          
          Might be helpful information.

          A shadow password is a file that stores encrypted passwords; it's
          accessible to only the root user on unix like systems.

          You can unshadow a password file using John's unshadow utility.

            ~$ umask 077; unshadow /.etc/passwd /etc/shadow > my_passwds.

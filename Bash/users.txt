SUID/SGID/Sticky, a clarification:

	Suid and sgid:

		The SUID flag causes executables to be executed under the owner user's permissions and
		the SGID flag, like SUID, causes executables to be exectued under the group's
		permissions.

	Setting them:

		You can set these bits with chmod by doing the following:

			~$ chmod g+xs <file_name> # Sets the SGID flag.
			~$ chmod u+xs <file_name> # Sets the SUID flag.

	Purpose:

		Only the root user can edit the etc/passwd file; the passwd command has the same
		permissions as the root user with the SUID flag set. 

		The reason why anyone can change their password is because the passwd command has
		the suid bit set to allow users to execute the passwd command under the 
                permissions of the root user; commands would otherwise be executed under the
		permissions of the user that called it.

		As another example, create a file and set its permissions:

		touch file.txt;echo "Hello!" > file.txt;chown root:root file.txt; \
			sudo chmod o-rwxs,g=rw,u=rw, test.txt

		This will create a file, enter some text into it, and change its ownership and permissions
		to and for the root.

		Neither you or I can read or write to this file with our user accounts; only root can.

		Now, create a bash file with the following contents and set the permissions and owner to root.

		0----------0
		#!/bin/bash

		cat file.txt 
		0----------0

		Set this bash script with the following ownership and permissions:

		chown root:root <file_name>.sh

		chmod u=rwxs,g=rwx,o=rx <file_name>.sh # or chmod 4770 <file_name>.sh.

		This ensure that the bash file executes with the SUID flag set and that others
		can't write to it; they can both read and execute because we need to be able
		to allow them to execute the script and we need to allow them to read it
		to do this.

		After doing so, execute the command.

		Since the bash script executes with the owner user's permissions, it's able
		to read the file called file.txt.

		You can see this by removing and readding the 's' flag via the command:

		sudo chmod u-s <file_name>.sh

		You'll note that without this flag set, you can execute it, but the
		internal command that accesses file.txt within, can't, because it 
		requires root privledges; the bash script in this case is executed
                under your privledges, which we set to none for the file file.txt.

		Setting both of these flags together causes a collage of permissions between
		group and owner user.

Numerics:

	4000 - Suid - For running files under users permissions.
	2000 - Sgid - For running files under group permissions.
	1000 - Save Text - For ensuring files can't be deleted by others (set to directories).


Idiosyncrasies:

	Behaviour:

		Setting SGID to a directory will cause all files created within that directory to be
		created under the group of the directory, rather than the user creating it; useful
		for shared directories.

	The sticky 't' bit:

		The sticky bit 't' flag ensures that only the creator of a file is able to
		delete the file.

		The sticky bit also has a numeric value, that being 1000.

		For files, this would have been used to 'pin in memory,' but it's now ignored.

		When used with directories, it ensures that only root, the file owner, and directory
		owner can delete a file (even if non-owners have write permissions); this is normally
		used for /tmp.

	Errors:

		In the output of ls -la, a captial letter will indicate that something is wrong. Normally,
		it means that execute permissions haven't been set.

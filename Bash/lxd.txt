Lxd:

	It's similar to docker, allowing you to create containers of linux systems;
	you're able to create full virtual machines with this, which is the
	key difference.

	It has its own set of commands, and a web interface similar to portainer.

	Lxd - Daemon.
	Lxc - Command.

	Lxc is a command line interface to the daemon.

	This command is primarly used for ubuntu, but you can do more than just 
	running ubuntu, you can also run windows and other linux distros.

	You can create a full blown virtual machine; you
	preset the system resouces. With a container, resources
	are used as they're needed; no preseting.

Installation:

	~$ sudo snap install lxd

	You may also specify the following commands to change the version or behaviour of lxc:

	~$ sudo snap install lxd --cohort="+"                # can be used to keep cluster members synchronized (don't worry about this if you're not clustering).
	~$ sudo snap install lxd --channel=<channel target>  # can be used to select different releases.
	~$ sudo snap install lxd --channel=6/stable for e.g. # installs stable six.

Post Install:

	getent group lxd | grep -qwF "$USER" || sudo usermod -aG lxd "$USER"

	Allow the current user to interact wit hthe LXD daemon; update LXD group.

	Use newgrp lxd to apply the change to the current shell session.

	sudo snap restart lxd

Initiallise the LXD instance:

	lxd init produces this output:

	~$ Do you want to use LXD clustering?
	~$ Do you want to configure a new storage pool?
	~$ (IF YES) Name of the storage backend (file system):
	~$ Create new <name> pool?
	~$ Use existing empty block device (disk or partition)?
	~$ Would you like to connect to a MAAS server?
	
	The question above is to do with bare metal; turns hardware into programmable, cloud-like bare metal
	infastructure. Interesting, but not needed all the time.

	~$ Would you like to create a new network bridge?

	This is used to create a bridge between the containers' and the host's network?

	~$ Would you like the Lxd server to be available over the network?

	Allows you to access the server remotely.

	~$ Would you like any cached images to be automatically updated?
	~$ Store configuration as YAML?

Creating images:

	~$ lxc launch remote:image containername

	Remote can be in these forms:
	
		1. ubuntu: this    serves official Ubuntu cloud image releases.

		2. ubuntu-daily:   this serves official Ubuntu cloud images of the daily development releases.

		3. ubuntu-minimal: this serves official Ubuntu Minimal cloud image releases.

		4. images:         this server provides unofficial images for a variety of Linux distributions. This
                                   is not the recommended server for Ubuntu images.

	The second parameter is the version; the first is the image of the operating system you're emulating.

	For example, you can write:

	~$ lxc launch ubuntu:24.04 ubuntu-container

Access an image instance:

	To get access to the container, you can use lxc shell <name of container>.

	You can also do lxc exec <name> -- bash, this opens a bash session.

	You can specify a command using lxd exec <command> as if its running on the container.

	You can use lxc info <name>, to check the containers info.

Stopping and starting an instance:

	lxc stop / start <name>

Renaming containers:

	You can change the name of the container using lxc move <old_name> <new_name>

Web Interface:

	The web interface can be found at 127.0.0.1:8443; it is kinda like a miniturised hypervisor.

	~$ lxc config set core.https_address :8443 # sets the webserver to port 8443 on localhost.

Certificate authentication:

	The website may want to install a certificate to ensure security by some means.

	You'll be given a series of instructions on first page load.

	In order for the browser certificate to the trust store, present a trust token generated
	by the server.

	You can replace 'lxd-ui' with the name you want to give the identity.

	~$ lxc auth identity create tls/lxd-ui --group admins

	Paste the output of this command in the website to
	authenticate it.

Gnome shell:

	Gnome shell extensions are a means of installing core user interface functions for gnome.

	These include the Panel at the top of the screen, activities overview, the message tray, etc.

	These are peices of code written by third party developers that modify the way gnome works; extensions can be
	mallicious for this reason. So don't install them willy nilly without properly reading into them.

	Gnome shell is the graphical shell of the gnome desktop environment; this is a pseudonym for graphical interface.

	A shell is a TUI environment and programming language pair; the borne again shell (bash) is an example.

Installation:

	Connector:

		The easiest way to install an extension and the connector is using the package manager:

		sudo apt-get install gnome-browser-connector -y

		The gnome browser connector is a connector for integrating gnome extensions to gnome; it connects to a web
		extension and allows you to download these interface functions from the web.

	Gnome web extension:

		To install the gnome shell extensions you
		need to enable the gnome web extension in your
		web browser; check for it in the
		extensions settings.

	Gnome tweaks (optional):

		You can install gnome tweaks to enable you to
		change a numbenr of settings like wall paper changes,
		start up applications, so on and so forth.

		sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks

		It's not required for extensions to work, its just a nice GUI.

	Gnome shell extensions:

		To install the actual extensions, go to the gnome extensions web page and
		just enable them; they'll be installed after that.

Enabling and disabling extensions:

	You can go to the tweaks app or use the web interface to enable or disable extensions.

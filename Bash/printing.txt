Cups:

The CUPS interface can be used for printing; this is a service provided by
apple and can be accessed at https://127.0.0.1:631. You can use
this to manage the printers on the same network.

You can do many things, like managing the print que, active jobs, etc.

It's a web interface for the CLI.

Postscript printer description:

	A PPD stands for Postscript Printer Description; these are files
	used to describe the stardards and driver programs used by
	the printer to ensure printing is properly performed.

	A class is a collection of printers; they're used to ditribute print
	jobs amongst a  group of printers or provide redunancy or high availablility 
	when printing.

Generic text printer:

	A generic text printer is printer that can be used to test
	if creating tasks is possible; this is used for fault finding to
	ensure the computer is functioning with respect to the interface.
	They're virtual printers.

Cli:

	There are two semantic forms for using the printing 
	interface; system V and berekly, both are unix-like 
	implementations of the same thing.

Adding printers:

	lpadmin - Used to manage printers.

	Lpadmin's flags:

		-D "Description" - Specifies the printer's description.
		-E "Enable" - Enabled the printer; accepts jobs.
		-m "Model" - Sets the printer driver using the model name.
		-o "Option" - Sets the named option; various options for the printer.
			e.g. name=value - Default value for named PPD option.
		-x "Delete" - Deletes the named printer.
		-v "Backend" - Used to specifiy the network address of the printer.

		Using the -v flag with lpinfo displays the available backends and printers; using
                the -m flagwith lpinfo displays the available drivers on the system.

	You can add a printer using lpadmin like so:

		~$ lpadmin -p <printer_name> -E -v <backend>:<ipv4_address> -m <drv>

Checking for available printers:

	~$ lpstat -p -d # prints the available printers.

	Note that lpstat alone, without flags, will display the jobs for each printer.

Printing:

	~$ lp <file_name> # prints the specified file to the default printer.
	~$ lp -d <printer_name> <file_name> will print to a specific printer.

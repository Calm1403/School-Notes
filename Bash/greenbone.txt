Installing:

		1.

			~$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

			This command uses curl and gpg to download and install the key respectively.

		2.

			~$ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

			This command will give write permissions to the docker.gpg file to all users of the system.

		3. 

			~$ echo \
				"deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
					"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable " | \
						sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

			This command adds the repository to the apt sources; since we've installed the key it'll install the package data providing the signature is valid.

		4. 
		
			~$ sudo apt update

		 	This command installs information about packages.

		5. 

			~$ sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

			This command installs the docker utils.

		6. 
			
			~$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && su $USER

			This command adds the user to the dockers group to permit them to use docker, then switches to them.

		7. 

			~$ export DOWNLOAD_DIR=$HOME/greenbone && mkdir -p $DOWNLOAD_DIR

			This command inserts the environment variable DOWNLOAD_DIR into the active shell session to refer to the greenbone directory again.

		8. 

			~$ curl -f -O -L https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/_static/docker-compose.yml --output-dir "$DOWNLOAD_DIR"

			This command will install the docker-compose.yml file; this is used for specifiying the services in our docker environment. 
			Note that you'll need to change the part of the file that specifies the IP to use it outside the OpenVAS VM under the gsa -> ports section
			of the config file (gsa and ports are key value pairs; they associate to values, where those values need to be changed).

		9. 

			~$ docker compose -f $DOWNLOAD_DIR/docker-compose.yml pull

			This will install the docker images based on the specification of the yml.

		10. 

			~$ docker compose -f $DOWNLOAD_DIR/docker-compose.yml up -d

			This will instanciate the docker container based on the specification of the yml.

		10 (optional). 
			
			~$ docker compose -f $DOWNLOAD_DIR/docker-compose.yml logs -f

		11. 

			~$ docker compose -f $DOWNLOAD_DIR/docker-compose.yml \
			    exec -u gvmd gvmd gvmd --user=admin --new-password='<password>'

			This will set the user name and password; the default is admin admin, hence why you should change it. The exec command will
			replace the execution of the shell with the process; the process takes on the shell's pid. This is likely for performance.
